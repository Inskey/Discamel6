# Discamel6
Discamel6 is a Discord library for Perl 6. It aims to provide all Discord functionality through an idiomatic, easy-to-understand, and robust API.

## Installing Discamel6
First make sure you have Perl 6 installed. Instructions for getting Rakudo Star (the Perl 6 tool suite) can be found [here](https://perl6.org/downloads)
```
git clone https://github.com/Inskey/Discamel6
cd Discamel6
perl6 installer.p6
```
The installer will take you through the rest of the installation. Read each question and answer carefully. Now, you can simply add `use Discamel6;` to the beginning of any files needing access to the API.
